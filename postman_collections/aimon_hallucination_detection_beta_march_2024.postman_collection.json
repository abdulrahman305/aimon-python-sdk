		"description": "## Overview\n\nThis is a beta version of **Aimon Rely.** It includes our proprietary hallucination detector. This is an beta-release, so please treat it as such. Check with us (send a note to [info@aimon.ai](https://mailto:info@aimon.ai)) before using this API in a production setting. There are limited uptime guarantees at the moment. Please report any issues to the Aimon team (at [info@aimon.ai](https://mailto:info@aimon.ai)).\n\n> Use the APIs with caution - do not send sensitive or protected data to this API. \n  \n\n## Features\n\nGiven a context and the generated text, we are able to detect 2 different types of model hallucinations: intrinsic and extrinsic.\n\n- The \"is_hallucinated\" field indicates whether the \"generated_text\" (passed in the input) is hallucinated.\n- A top level passage level \"score\" indicates if the entire set of sentences contain any hallucinations. The score is a probabilty measure of how hallucinated the text is compared to the context. A score >= 0.5 can be classified as a hallucination.\n- We also provide sentence level scores to help with explanability.\n    \n\n## **Limitations**\n\n- Input payloads with context sizes greater than 32,000 tokens will not work at the moment.\n- Maximum batch size is 25 items at the moment.",
