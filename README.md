# ðŸŽ‰**Welcome to AIMon Rely**

AIMon Rely is a state-of-the-art system consisting of multiple models for detecting LLM quality issues during offline evaluations and continuous production monitoring. We offer
hallucination metrics that is fast, reliable and cost-effective. We also support additional metrics such as
completeness, conciseness and toxicity. 

Read our [blog post](https://aimon.ai/blogs/introducing-rely) for more details.

## Metrics Supported

These are the quality metrics that are currently available via the API. Some of them are in progress and will be
available in a future release.

| Metric                                           | Status                                                       |

## Getting Started

### SDK and UI

AIMon supports asynchronous instrumentation or synchronous detections for the metrics mentioned above. Use these steps
to get started with using the AIMon SDK and the product.

- Step 1: Get access to the beta product by joining the wait list on our [website](https://aimon.ai/) or by requesting
          it on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/generativeair/shared_invite/zt-2jab62lsj-xM9a_s~Qweu8lf3YS2cANg) or sending an email to info@aimon.ai
- Step 2: Install the AIMon SDK by running `pip install aimon` in your terminal.
- Step 3: Refer to the [sample notebook](examples/notebooks/aimon_sdk_langchain_summarization.ipynb) for an example of how to instrument an LLM application asynchronously using the SDK.
          You can also refer to the sample [streamlit application](examples/langchain_summarization_app.py) for an example for synchronous detections.

### API

AIMon detections can be accessed via REST APIs. Here are the steps to access the API:

- Step 1: Get your API key by requesting it on our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/generativeair/shared_invite/zt-2jab62lsj-xM9a_s~Qweu8lf3YS2cANg) or sending an email
  to info@aimon.ai
- Step 2: Download the [Postman Collection](examples/postman_collections) specified below to access the API

### Sandbox

You can try our [Sandbox](https://aimon.ai/tryproduct) that is available on our website to try our Hallucination detection models quickly.

## Benchmarks

### Hallucination Detection
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we benchmarked it against popular industry benchmarks for the
hallucination detection task. The table below shows our results.

A few key takeaways:

âœ… AIMon Rely is **10x cheaper** than GPT-4 Turbo.

âœ… AIMon Rely is **4x faster** than GPT-4 Turbo.

âœ… AIMon Rely provides the convenience of a fully hosted API that includes baked-in explainability.

âœ… Support for a context length of up to 32,000 tokens (with plans to further expand this in the near future).

Overall, AIMon Rely is 10 times cheaper, 4 times faster and close to or even **better than GPT-4** on the benchmarks
making it a suitable choice for both offline and online detection of hallucinations.

### Completeness, Conciseness Detection

There is a lack of industry standard benchmark datasets for these metrics. We will be publishing an evaluation dataset soon.

## Pricing

Please reach out to info@aimon.ai for pricing details related to the product and the API.

## Future Work

- We are working on additional metrics as detailed in the table above.
- In addition, we are working on something awesome to make the offline evaluation and continuous model quality
  monitoring experience more seamless.
